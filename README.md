## AI for good

Take a look at some of the AI-for-good and data-for-good projects I've been involved in

* World Data League 2023: my team (AI Wonder Girls) won first prize for our solution to promoting sustainable energy communities among residents of a Belgian city, using data to fight energy poverty and reduce carbon footprints. In earlier phases of the competition, we also provided solutions for understanding the biodiveristy of marine species and modelling traffic movements to reduce reliance on cars.

* DataKind UK & Evidence for Development: Evidence for Development is an NGO that maps data-driven "livelihood zones" to a country to improve the quality of interventions for development and disaster response. Mapping livelihood zones is very labour-intensive, so we used open-source data (remote sensing, transport and other geospatial data) to prototype an automated way to replace the first stage of this process, potentially speeding it up by a year or more per country.

## Neuroscience & neuroAI

* In my PhD I used reinforcement learning models to understand how the brain "at rest" (sleeping, or quietly resting) contributes to offline learning and memory processes. I found that reward prediction errors are likely to influence which brain activity gets replayed during offline states.

* Inspired by the surprising links between reinforcement learning in brains and reinforcement learning as a branch of artificial intelligence, I also published a paper on how researchers in both fields might benefit from the advances in the other field.
